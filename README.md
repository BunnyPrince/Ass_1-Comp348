## Updates September 29th, 2020 (noah)

- refactored 'objects' to 'employeeObj'
- changed to way to display the sorted array (vertical list instead of an array on one big line)
- use a method reference to write display for sorted by id
- delete for-statement used to display the sorted salaries (since for/while loops are not allowed)
